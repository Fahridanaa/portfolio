Komikrr is a comic reading website I made to try out SvelteKit and practice my web development skills. I was honestly just messing around, but it turned into something pretty cool!

Here's what it looks like in action:

I used some pretty neat tools to build this:
- **SvelteKit**: The main framework - it's been super fun to work with!
- **Shadcn-Svelte**: For those slick-looking UI components
- **TailwindCSS**: Making everything look good without losing my mind with CSS
- **PostgreSQL**: Keeping all the comic data organized
- **Cloudinary**: Handling all the comic images

One of the coolest parts of this project is how I get the comics. I built a Python script that scrapes comic data using BeautifulSoup4. It's like having a robot that reads comic websites and saves all the good stuff. And here's how it looks in action:

```terminal
(venv) C:\Users\fahri\Documents\project\comic_scraper_api>python main.py solo-leveling

### What I Learned
This project taught me a bunch of stuff:
- SvelteKit is awesome for building full-stack apps
- Managing state in Svelte is way simpler than I expected
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM = A really nice database setup
- It was a fun to practice my Python skills with the scraper
